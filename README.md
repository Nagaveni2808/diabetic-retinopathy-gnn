# 🧠 Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using Graph Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can classify diabetic retinopathy stages from retinal images. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and improve accuracy over traditional CNN approaches.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview
- Source: APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection (Kaggle)
- Total Images: ~10,000
- Labels: 0 (No DR), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe), 4 (Proliferative DR)

## 🧠 Approach
- Image preprocessing and resizing
- Feature extraction using CNN
- Graph construction from image features
- Model built with Graph Neural Networks (e.g., GCN/GAT)
- Accuracy: ~95%, reduced false negatives by 5%

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Gained experience in PyTorch Geometric
- Understood medical image classification with graphs
- Improved understanding of model interpretability
